Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a strong graphic design background. I spent the last 14 years working for an interactive agency called L2 Interactive. At L2, I was the lead designer for web design concepts and email marketing. In the last 3 years, I directed my focus fro web design to front-end web development which includes creating web interaction, user experience and bringing websites to life through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP.
